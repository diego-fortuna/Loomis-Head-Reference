Loomis Head Reference     |     Diego Fortuna
---------------------------------------------

The software's goal is to help you draw a Loomis Head from whatever perspective you like.
Rotate the already built Loomis Head and copy it by hand or export it as an image to use in your drawing!

Quick features listing:
	Zoom Slider: lets you zoom in/out the camera (in Perspective mode it changes the FOV);
	Planes Check Box: toggles the planes visibility (hair line, brow line, nose line and chin line);
	Orthogonal / Perspective Select Box: lets you select the camera projection;
	Rotation Sliders: let you change the rotation of the camera by a fixed value (30 by default);
	Digit Boxes: let you change the fixed value of the rotation;
	Reset Buttons: let you reset the rotation;
	Axis Frame: lets you see the axis rotation of the head;
	Lock Button: lets you lock the window (always on top);
	Export Button: lets you export the Loomis Head as a png to use in your drawing.

Remember that exported images will be saved in the same folder of the software .EXE file.

Features to be implemented as soon as possible:
	Multiple Head Types
	Roll Axis Rotation
	Custom Heads

The software is made in Godot 4.2.2 and is completely open source, please remember to give me some credit though!
